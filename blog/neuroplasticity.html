        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h3>Kia mate ururoa, kei mate wheke. <em>Fight like a shark, don’t give in like an octopus.</em> </h3>

         <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that you can change your brain. Nobody is born with a finite amount of intelligence. Your brain is composed of neurons that are connected in paths. Every time you learn something new, a new path forms. With practice, those neural pathways become stronger and stronger. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help people shirk expectations of immediate success or perfectionism. Instead, they can lean into learning processes and persist through struggle knowing that they are not “dumb” or “bad”. They are simply new to a process and are still developing the pathways they need to be successful. 
         </p>
         <p>I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity any time I give something a go or try something new. Trying new things not only develops neural pathways but also increases your ability to learn. It's the same idea as practice makes perfect. Instead of just practicing one thing to develop a neural pathway, the more neural pathways you create, the easier it is to create more! You can also increase your neuroplasticity through practice and failure. You learn more from your failures than you do from your successes so trying and failing is better to build neuroplasticity than if you were to just be successful from the start every time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOJL3gjc8ak&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Kelly Lambert</strong> </a>shares a great TED Talk about ways we can improve our neuroplasticity.

         <p>Growth Mindset is the idea that intelligence is dynamic and not static. People with growth mindsets understand that it is their effort that is the most important factor to success - not innate talent or ability. The opposite of growth mindsets and fixed mindsets. People with fixed mindsets put more worth on the appearance of being smart instead of the work behind it. These people are more likely to give up with things get hard or challenging instead of viewing it as an opportunity to learn. 
         </p>
         <p>My thesis for my Master of Education was centered around the idea of improving students’ growth mindsets so none of these ideas were new or surprising to me. I remember learning about it for the first time though and was surprised how much the way you praise people can affect mindset. I didn’t realize there was a difference between praising ability compared to praising effort. After learning about these, I immediately put them forth in my teaching practice. Learning the theory of growth mindset has helped me embrace the journey more and put less pressure on myself to make things look easy. I place a greater emphasis on working hard now and trying to learn from my mistakes. One of my favorite researchers around growth mindset is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3icoSeGqQtY&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" target="_blank"><strong>Jo Boaler</strong></a>. She is a mathematics educator but I think her ideas around math - a subject that can be incredibly polarizing to people - can also apply to our journey of learning coding. I definitely still have insecurities pop up about being the best or looking dumb, but I am always reminding myself if I am not making mistakes and putting in effort, then what am I learning or how am I growing?
