        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h3>"Everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has those days." - Hannah Montana</em> </h3>
        <h5>1 February 2024</h5>
    
         <p><strong>
            A time I was blocked on a simple problem:
        </strong>  </p>
         <p>
            I got stuck on the whereAreYou problem where we had to find which door Scooby was behind. I was feeling very frustrated and felt like I had tried everything. I was doing a lot of research, trying different things, and reading error messages but nothing was making sense. I didn’t understand the syntax to use .find() when looking through objects. It was getting late though so I didn’t think anyone would be available to help me so I decided to take a pause my work for the day and get back to it the next day. I think that was a good decision for me because I felt way more refreshed and clear-headed when I looked back at the problem the next day. Before I reached out for help, I decided to put my code into AI to fix it because I felt like I was on the right track but something was just wrong. As it turns out, I was overcomplicating it completely. I just had to take out two words and my code worked! After this example, I understood arrow functions, objects, and the .find() method a lot better!
         </p>
         <p><strong>
            A time I elegantly solved a problem:
        </strong></p>
         <p>
            By the time I got to the deBee problem, I was feeling really good about my learning. I was able to break down the steps I needed to take to solve the problem correctly and I felt confident about my knowledge of .filter() syntax as I had researched it earlier in the sprint. I was logging everything to the console too so I could see exactly what was going on. Everything was going smoothly until I got to the part where I needed to make sure the function filtered out the buzzes regardless of the case. I did some research and websites were telling me to use the .toLowerCase function() so I used that at the very beginning of the function to make everything lowercase. As it turns out, it made the last test pass but it failed the second test because the second test had a string that still needed capital letters. I reassessed and figured out where I needed to use it in the .filter() arrow function that I wrote. It didn’t work at first because of a spelling mistake but I quickly caught that because of the error message that popped up. The whole time I felt confident and level-headed because even though I ran into errors, I knew exactly what my next step was going to be. After this example, I understood how to filter more specifically and the importance of order in a function better.

         <p><strong>
            Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </strong></p>
         <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I am doing okay at this. I started using it at first but eventually stopped on the problems that confused me. If I wasn’t sure where to start I just started trying something instead of writing pseudocode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trying something</strong> - This is my go-to! It gives me a starting ground for where to start. I use the error messages and the console.log to then to continue problem-solving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I haven’t used this one at all. But I feel like I just doing things very incorrectly right now and maybe when I have a better conceptual grounding in JavaScript then this will be more helpful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I often try to use error messages. I find them helpful about half the time because sometimes it isn’t clear what is wrong with my code. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Googling</strong> - I use this one just as much as trying something! It’s more helpful for learning the correct syntax and copying examples than explaining concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Console.logging</strong> - I’ve gotten a lot better at using this one by the end of the kata.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - I’m not super confident with this one just because my ego gets in the way. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I’m getting better with this one. I’ve been mostly going to the coaches to explain things that I’m not understanding just from my internet research. My ego gets in the way a little bit with this one just because I don’t see too many other people asking questions and I feel like I should be able to get it on my own.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I feel confident with this one! I am always looking back into my notes for how to do something or how I fixed a mistake!
                </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p><strong>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </strong> </p>
         <p>
            I absolutely did not want to ask for help on the Gradebook challenge.  I was having trouble creating a function that assigned students to the gradebook and then another one assigning the scores. I ended up writing out the objects quite easily but I had this sinking feeling that I took the easy way out and that wasn’t what the question was actually looking for even though it passed the tests. I saw other students were writing the functions and I didn’t understand what was happening in them. I should have asked my facilitator and now that I see more people are asking questions, I might have. I eventually went back and redid the questions using functions because I understood them better by the end of the kata assignments but I realize that if I had asked for help then - the rest of the kata would have been much easier.
