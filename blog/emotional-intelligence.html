        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h3>He aha te kai ō te rangatira? He kōrero, he kōrero, he kōrero. <em>What is the food of the leader? It is knowledge. It is communication.</em> </h3>

         <p>IQ is a common household term that people use to describe a person’s intelligence. Usually, the higher the IQ someone has, the smarter they are considered to be. Higher IQs are also associated with a higher likelihood of success. Is that true though? Is IQ the defining factor for intelligence and success?
        </p>
        <p>
            IQ is used to describe the overall mental ability of a person. This includes visual and spatial processing, working and short-term memory, fluid and quantitative reasoning, and general knowledge of the world. IQ is usually assessed through standardized tests and is considered to affect academics, expertise, critical thinking, and logic. However, the validity of IQ has been called into question. The idea of intelligence can be relative and the standardized tests that are used to assess people are often biased against many minority groups including black and brown people. This is because of the numerous environmental factors that can affect a person including upbringing, experiences, cultural factors, and trauma. So what else is there?
         </p>
         <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to perceive, control, evaluate and express emotions. It is an entirely separate skill set from IQ that focuses more on a person’s interpersonal and internal relationships. EQ focuses on relating to others, social communication, and evaluating and perceiving how others feel. It also concerns more meta processes like identifying and controlling one’s emotions. EQ is different from IQ because it affects a person’s motivation, relationships, self-awareness, self-control, and ability to empathize. All of these traits are extremely important in determining the overall success of a person.
        </p>
          <p>
            Although EQ is affected by the same environmental factors as IQ, it adds a layer of humanity when discussing the idea of intelligence. EQ is important because people would rather work with others who have higher EQs. EQ becomes even more important when in leadership roles. Unsurprisingly, leaders with higher EQs tend to be more successful than those with lower ones. These are the leaders who have better communication, more empathy and are generally able to read people better. I think having a high EQ is also important because I think it would lead to a greater sense of contentment and inner peace. Luckily, emotional intelligence is a set of skills that can be trained, continuously practiced, and shared with others.
