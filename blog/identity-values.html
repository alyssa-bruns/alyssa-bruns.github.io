            The school that I taught at had a large Indian population. During my time there, I truly enjoyed the relationships I built with my students- particularly when I learned about and celebrated their varied cultures. During Punjabi Language Week we participated in several activities with the students. Our Punjabi students taught us words, we made art, and we cooked delicious food with their families. During one art project, students were learning to draw meaningful symbols. Some of my students started drawing swastikas. As a Jewish person, I was immediately uncomfortable. I've always known that the swastika had been appropriated by the Nazis, but I never really knew the background. I wasn't sure how to proceed, so I started asking questions. I asked my students about the drawings and what they meant. They chattered away at me as they drew on happily. They explained that in Hinduism, it meant peace or good luck. I noticed the differences too- how colorful they were and decorated with dots and patterns. They didn't know that it could also mean other things. The lump in my throat started to subside, but I still had decisions to make. I almost always hung up the art my students made. I wanted to continue doing so to celebrate and honor the cultures they came from. But I was also very aware that the symbols they drew had developed different meanings that hurt me and those I love. I could have hung up only some of the pictures, but that felt wrong as well. At the end of the day, I decided to hang up each piece of art. I felt that if I, a Jewish person, could recognize the differences, understand the nuances, and explain the context of the symbol, then others would have to be okay with it as well. I decided to look past my Western-centered ideas and uplift my students. They were so stoked to see their art up. Their joy made the choice worth it. If given the choice, I would choose to hang up the art again.

            I grew up on the Jersey Shore in a working-class family. I had everything I needed and most of what I wanted. I was fortunate enough to grow up privileged with supportive parents. I knew my parents were not as lucky as me and did everything they could to provide better for me and my brother. My parents always emphasized the importance of family, generosity, and emotional intelligence which I still carry with me today. Some stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason and I grew up in fast fast-paced, competitive environments. After University, I got my first job and moved to Hawai'i. My world was turned on its head. The pace was slower and relaxed. I had to learn how to communicate with my coworkers in new ways. I soon learned building relationships with them was more important than completing tasks. While I grew up in New Jersey, I found myself in Hawai'i. I learned what was important to me there and the best parts of myself came through. I loved being part of and serving my community. I loved the inherent relationship I built with the land and the general air of gratitude in everyday life.

        <p><strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

            I think my biggest strength is my ability to analyze and problem-solve. I'm tenacious and hate to leave a project unfinished. I also enjoy working with others and building from their ideas. Reflecting upon my strengths is what led me to pursue software development. These strengths will help me not only learn something new but also as pursue a career in programming. I also really enjoy asking the big questions. This doesn't always mean coming up with ideas but I think it helps stimulate conversation and helps bring other's ideas into the mix.

        <p><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
       </strong></p>
          <p>
            I tend to be pretty passive and have difficulty addressing my problems with others. This leads to built-up resentment that could be rectified immediately if I just speak up about it. When working with others, you need to pick your battles and work through problems. Letting things fester usually makes everything worse. I know I'll continue working collaboratively in this program and my future career. Addressing problems is something that I'll have to continue working on. I'm also not the best at galvanizing or garnering enthusiasm for a project. While everyone has their strengths, I have to work on being an advocate for myself so my ideas aren't pushed aside.

        <p><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
       </strong></p>
          <p>I've had to work in a bunch of different teams before. I've come to learn that there are some people you work well with while others will be a struggle. I've tried to practice not taking it too personally, but sometimes it's still hard. The times I've struggled the hardest are when people have consistently ignored the agreements of a team. I tried to see things from their perspective and remind myself that we are working toward a common goal. I've tried to let things go because they weren't worth it, but I know now that these issues tend to build up for me. If I were to do it again, I would try talking to a mentor sooner about what was happening. I would also try using the procedures that we had in place for addressing problems. I think I get so worried about not becoming a problem that I don't raise issues when they happen. It's something to work on!</p>
