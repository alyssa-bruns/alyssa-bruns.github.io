         <p><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
         </strong></p>
         <p>
            I’ve learned how hard it is to keep to a self-paced schedule and to take the appropriate self-care breaks even if you have the best intentions. I’ve learned how hard it is to not constantly compare yourself and progress to that of your classmates. I’ve learned how hard it can be to think like a developer and break problems down into little steps to solve them. 
         </p>
         <p><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
         </strong></p>
         <p>
            I think it has the same role as any other job:  It makes you a better person to be around and work with, it helps you be better at your job, and it helps maintain your hauora.
         </p>
         <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
         </strong></p>
         <p>What surprised me the most about core learning was how hard it is to think like a developer. When I first read about it, the concept really resonated with me. But in application I found myself hitting a lot of roadblocks. I wouldn’t know what the next step would be, or worse, I wouldn’t even know the questions to ask to set me on the right path. 
         </p>
         <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
         </strong></p>
         <p>The most challenging aspect of the core learning was doing the journals and reflections. I don’t like writing so this was one of the more painful and forced assignments for me to complete. 
         </p>
         <p><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
         </strong></p>
         <p>
            I think it is easy to focus on only the hard skills in a program like this but by learning the soft skills that we do in core learning, we are making ourselves more hirable and will better improve our success in the real world. It’s not enough to just know the hard skills but we want to be well-rounded people in general.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
         </strong></p>
         <p>No, I don’t think it was a waste of time just because I know how valuable these skills are for people. Even though the majority weren’t new to me, I found them to be useful reminders to myself because consistently applying the ideas is very different than just learning about them.
