         <p><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?

        </strong></p>
        <p>
            My long-term goal is to get a job that is flexible about working in the office and working remotely somewhere in the tech sector. While I don’t know exactly what job I am looking for yet, I want one that has opportunities for career advancement and extended learning opportunities. My ideal would be to end up in a supportive organization that aligns with my values.
         </p>
         <p><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </strong></p>
          <p>
            When it comes to learning, I am very motivated and I have great organizational skills. For the most part, I can stick to a plan and will use the learning strategies that I find help me best. Sometimes I can hyper-fixate and get carried away with a task. I’ll keep playing around and going back to something if I don’t think it is quite right even if I have other things to do. I know this isn’t the best use of my time especially when I had timetabled other things into my schedule. Sometimes I need someone to just reassure or remind me that it’s enough and to just let it be. I’m more of a visual and kinesthetic learner. I don’t get much out of something but just reading or just listening. I need multiple take in information in multiple different ways for me to fully understand it. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

       </strong></p>
          <p>
            I would like to work on advocating more for myself, working on tech challenges as a team, and planning a more efficient work day whether it be at home or in an office. 
          </p>
        </p>
        <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
           <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives </li> 
           <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
       </strong></p>
          <p>To manage workloads, I usually do a stocktake to look at what needs to be accomplished overall at the beginning of the week or project and then break it down into manageable steps. I like to set out realistic goals to accomplish each day. I will give myself a little wiggle room at the end of the week for make-up time in case something took longer than I had anticipated earlier in the week. I think this would work well in a team environment as well because then everyone would be on the same page about what needs to be done and the project's general timeline .
            </p><p>
            With this planning, I’d be able to see in advance if many things are taking longer than anticipated and I find myself falling behind on my schedule. This would allow me the opportunity to contact facilitators, peers, etc ahead of time and ask for help or give a warning about the timeline change. If things are starting to build up and I get overwhelmed, I would contact facilitators or my team to reach out for help.
            </p>
        <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
         </strong></p>
         <p>I know I can reach out for help at any time on Discord whether it be from peers, facilitators, or the wider Dev Academy community. I would also follow up with facilitators via email if I wanted a clearer trail of communication. I aim to reach out for help before I am in too deep.
        </p>
        <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </strong></p>
        <p>I expect the facilitation team to communicate expectations and availability with us clearly and regularly. I also expect them to help us the best they can. If they can’t provide a reliable answer themselves, I expect them to point us in the direction of someone or a resource that can. As with any person I would want them to be empathetic and kind to us and show everyone an equal amount of respect.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </strong></p>
        <p>I don’t have anything in my day that ultimately can’t be rescheduled. For my mental and physical health, I plan to include workouts that are regular and at consistent times that I don’t want to be interrupted. These can work around whatever schedule is in place/agreed upon.
